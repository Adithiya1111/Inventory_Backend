# Inventory_Backend
Backend for Inventory Management System

📦 Inventory Management System (Back-End)
A simple console-based Inventory Management System built using Java and MySQL that performs essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing product inventory. This back-end application is designed to interact directly with a MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), making it ideal for learning and demonstrating how Java applications can interface with relational databases.

🔧 Features
✅ Add Item – Insert new inventory items into the database.

📋 View Items – Display all items stored in the inventory.

🔁 Update Item – Modify existing item details (name, quantity, or price).

❌ Delete Item – Remove an item from the database using its ID.

🧩 Menu-Driven CLI – Intuitive text-based menu to perform operations interactively.

🔒 Secure Database Access – Uses PreparedStatements to prevent SQL injection.

📎 Auto Resource Management – Closes database and scanner resources gracefully.

📁 Prerequisites
Java JDK 8 or higher

MySQL Server running on localhost:3306

MySQL JDBC Driver (e.g., mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar)

Any IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal for compilation and execution

🛠️ Technologies Used
💻 Java

🗃️ MySQL

🔗 JDBC API

🧪 SQL

📜 CLI (Command Line Interface)
